I don't like repeating the function name

hypenToCamelCase ('-':'-':xs) = hypenToCamelCase ('-':xs)
hypenToCamelCase ('-':x:xs)   = toUpper x : hypenToCamelCase xs
hypenToCamelCase ('-':xs)     = hypenToCamelCase xs
hypenToCamelCase (x:xs)       = x : hypenToCamelCase xs
hypenToCamelCase []           = []

nor do I like to separate it into a `case .. of', or a `where ...',
best to make it easy to write like this:

hypenToCamelCase
  ('-':'-':xs) = hypenToCamelCase ('-':xs)
  ('-':x:xs)   = toUpper x : hypenToCamelCase xs
  ('-':xs)     = hypenToCamelCase xs
  (x:xs)       = x : hypenToCamelCase xs
  []           = []
